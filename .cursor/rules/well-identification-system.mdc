# well-identification-system

The well identification system extracts and validates critical well information from LAS file headers to ensure accurate well tracking and prevent cross-well confusion in multi-well operations.

## Core Components

### Header Parser
Located in `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
- Extracts well metadata from LAS header sections
- Validates required well identifiers (UWI, API numbers)
- Maps non-standard header variations to normalized formats
- Importance Score: 85

### Well Information Display
Located in `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
- Presents extracted well data in UI card format
- Color-coded status indicators for validation state
- Prominent display of critical identifiers
- Importance Score: 75

### Multi-Well Management
Located in `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
- Maintains distinct well contexts during batch processing
- Prevents cross-contamination between well data
- Enforces unique well identification across session
- Importance Score: 80

## Business Rules

1. Well Identifier Requirements
- Must extract at least one primary identifier (UWI or API)
- Secondary identifiers required for cross-validation
- Validation fails if conflicting identifiers found
- Importance Score: 90

2. Well Context Isolation
- State cleanup required between well processing
- Explicit user confirmation for well switches
- Prevention of concurrent well processing
- Importance Score: 85

## Domain-Specific Validation

### Identifier Validation
- Checks for standard industry formats (API/UWI)
- Validates regional identifier compliance
- Cross-references against known patterns
- Importance Score: 80

### Error Handling
- Detailed feedback for identification failures
- Specific remediation steps for invalid identifiers
- Warning system for ambiguous well data
- Importance Score: 75
