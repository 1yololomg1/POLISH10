# state-management

The system does not contain explicit state management documentation in the provided specification. Based on the business domain context, the following high-level state aspects can be inferred:

## Data Flow Components

The state management would likely involve:

- Environmental correction state tracking between processing stages
- Preservation of calibration parameters during multi-well analysis
- Stateful tracking of quality control flags
- Management of visualization states for log displays

## Petrophysical Processing State

The saturation model implementations require managing:

- Formation parameter states
- Regional calibration coefficients
- Model selection criteria states
- Quality control flags

## Log Display State

The log display renderer maintains:

- Track configuration states
- Scaling parameters
- Crossover detection states
- Depth correlation states

## State Dependencies

Critical state relationships exist between:

- Environmental corrections and quality control flags
- Formation parameters and saturation model selection
- Regional calibrations and correction factors

While specific state management implementations are not detailed, the business logic indicates stateful processing requirements for maintaining petrophysical analysis integrity across the workflow components.
