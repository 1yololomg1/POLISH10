### State Cleanup System
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
**Importance Score**: 95

A comprehensive state reset mechanism preventing cross-contamination between well data processing:
- Clears all state variables related to well data
- Resets curve information and processing results
- Purges geological context data
- Ensures clean slate for new well processing

### Multiwell State Management
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
**Importance Score**: 85

System for handling multiple well states simultaneously:
- Maintains separate state containers for each loaded well
- Implements active well selection and switching
- Preserves processing state for each well independently
- Manages concurrent well data processing states

### Well Information State
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
**Importance Score**: 80

State management for well identification and metadata:
- Extracts and maintains well information from LAS headers
- Updates UI components with current well state
- Manages color-coded well identification displays
- Maintains well context across processing operations

### Unit Conversion State
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
**Importance Score**: 75

Tracks and manages unit conversion states:
- Maintains conversion approval status
- Stores preview information for conversions
- Manages user confirmation states
- Preserves original and converted unit information
