# State Management

### Core State Components

1. Well State Management
- Maintains current well context and metadata
- Prevents cross-contamination between multiple wells
- Importance Score: 85
- File Path: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

2. State Cleanup Procedures
- Comprehensive reset mechanism for all data structures
- Clears well identification and processing states
- Validates state consistency after cleanup
- Importance Score: 80
- File Path: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

3. Multiwell Data Handling
- Independent state management for each loaded well
- Supports collective and individual well processing
- Maintains isolated processing contexts
- Importance Score: 80
- File Path: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### State-Driven UI Components

1. Well Information Display
- Color-coded status indicators reflect current well state
- Updates UI card with active well metadata
- Visual confirmation of processing state
- Importance Score: 70
- File Path: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

2. Unit Conversion State
- Manages conversion approval workflow
- Preserves conversion history per well
- Tracks applied transformations
- Importance Score: 75
- File Path: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### Data Flow Control

1. Depth Validation State
- Tracks validation status and failure reasons
- Maintains remediation steps per well
- Preserves validation history
- Importance Score: 85
- File Path: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

2. Gap Classification State
- Maintains geological feature classifications
- Tracks error conditions vs natural features
- Stores threshold configurations
