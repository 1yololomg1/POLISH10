# state-management

The state management system implements specialized handling for well data processing with three core components:

### Well Dataset Mapping
- Maintains a structured mapping between well identifiers and their associated datasets
- Tracks processing status, validation results, and metadata for each well
- Prevents accidental cross-referencing between different wells' data
- **Importance Score**: 85
- **File Path**: `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### State Cleanup Mechanism
- Implements comprehensive reset functionality to clear application state between well loads
- Removes all temporary processing artifacts and intermediate results
- Resets validation flags and processing indicators
- Forces explicit cleanup of memory-intensive well data structures
- **Importance Score**: 90
- **File Path**: `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### Cross-Contamination Prevention
- Enforces strict isolation between multiple well datasets
- Validates well identifiers before any state mutations
- Requires explicit user confirmation for state-changing operations
- Maintains separate validation contexts for each well
- **Importance Score**: 95
- **File Path**: `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

The system uses a domain-specific approach focusing on data integrity and safety in multi-well processing scenarios, with particular attention to preventing any mixing of data between different wells during processing operations.
