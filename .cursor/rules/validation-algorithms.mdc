## Depth Validation System
Core validation logic integrates geological context with tool-specific data quality checks:

1. Environmental Correction Validation
- Borehole size validation against tool specifications
- Temperature drift validation using Arp's formula thresholds
- Quality flagging based on hole conditions and mudcake effects
- Tool-specific calibration factor verification

2. Regional Parameter Validation
- Formation-specific Archie parameter bounds checking
- Basin calibration consistency validation
- Lithology-dependent correction factor ranges
- Gap filling threshold validation based on geological zones

3. Quality Control Mechanisms
The system implements industry-standard quality checks:

- Tool-specific environmental corrections validation
- Formation evaluation parameter verification
- Regional calibration consistency checks
- Depth-based data quality assessment

## Validation Architecture
Located in core/environmental_corrections.py:

1. Quality Flag Generation:
- Automated detection of invalid tool responses
- Environmental condition verification
- Calibration factor range checking
- Depth alignment validation

2. Validation Thresholds:
- Formation-specific parameter bounds
- Tool-specific calibration ranges
- Environmental correction limits
- Regional parameter constraints

3. Feedback Systems:
- Quality control indicators
- Validation status reporting
- Correction factor verification
- Parameter bound checking

Importance Score: 85/100
The validation system implements sophisticated domain-specific quality control mechanisms critical for accurate petrophysical analysis.
