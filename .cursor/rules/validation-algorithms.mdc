The depth validation system implements critical safety checks for well data processing:

1. Detailed Feedback Mechanism
- Replaces silent validation failures with comprehensive error messages
- Provides specific metrics about validation failures
- Includes step-by-step remediation instructions
- Generates validation reports with failure reasons

2. Error Classification System
- Enhanced `categorize_error()` method for depth-related issues
- User-friendly message generation for each error category
- Specific remediation steps by error type
- Prioritized handling of validation failures

## Unit Validation Framework
**File**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
**Importance Score**: 85
