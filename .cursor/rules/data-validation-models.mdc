# data-validation-models

### DepthValidationResult Dataclass
Core model for depth validation results containing:
- Validation status (pass/fail)
- Failure reasons with detailed metrics
- Remediation steps and guidance
- Quality indicators (0-100 scale)
- Well identification metadata

File path: `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
Importance Score: 95

### Depth Validation Algorithm
Validates depth curves with specialized checks:
- Step size consistency analysis
- Missing value detection and impact assessment
- Unit compatibility verification
- Depth range validation against expected values
- Cross-well depth alignment checks for multi-well scenarios

File path: `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
Importance Score: 90

### Validation Feedback Generator
Produces structured feedback containing:
- Specific failure categories with descriptions
- Quantitative metrics showing deviation from expected values
- Color-coded severity indicators
- Step-by-step remediation instructions
- Links to relevant documentation/procedures

File path: `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py` 
Importance Score: 85

### Domain-Specific Validation Rules
- Well confusion prevention through metadata cross-validation
- Unit conversion safety checks with user confirmation requirements
- Depth range verification against regional norms
- Multi-well depth correlation checks
- Data integrity validation for critical well parameters

File path: `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
Importance Score: 90
