# well-data-models

## LAS Header Information Model
Essential well identification data extracted and structured from LAS file headers:
- Well name
- UWI (Unique Well Identifier)
- Field name
- Operating company
- Date information
- Depth range details
- Location coordinates

**Importance Score**: 90
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

## DepthValidationResult Data Structure
Specialized dataclass for validating depth curves with:
- Validation status
- Detailed failure reasons
- Specific metrics for depth inconsistencies
- Required remediation steps
- Data quality indicators

**Importance Score**: 85
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

## Well Dataset Mapping
Well information tracking system that maintains:
- Current active well state
- Multi-well session management
- Data relationships between wells
- Status indicators for processing stages
- Geological feature classifications

**Importance Score**: 80
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

## Gap Classification Schema
Domain-specific logic for categorizing data gaps:
- Distinction between measurement errors and geological features
- Configurable thresholds for gap classification
- Detailed explanation system for identified gaps
- Remediation guidance based on gap type

**Importance Score**: 85
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
