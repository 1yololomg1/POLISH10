## LAS Header Information Model
Essential well identification data extracted and structured from LAS file headers:
- Well name
- UWI (Unique Well Identifier)
- Field name
- Operating company
- Date information
- Depth range details
- Location coordinates
**Importance Score**: 90
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
## DepthValidationResult Data Structure
Specialized dataclass for validating depth curves with:
- Validation status
- Detailed failure reasons
- Specific metrics for depth inconsistencies
- Required remediation steps
- Data quality indicators
**Importance Score**: 85
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
## Well Dataset Mapping
Well information tracking system that maintains:
- Current active well state
- Multi-well session management
- Data relationships between wells
- Status indicators for processing stages
- Geological feature classifications
**Importance Score**: 80
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
## Gap Classification Schema
Domain-specific logic for categorizing data gaps:
- Distinction between measurement errors and geological features
- Configurable thresholds for gap classification
- Detailed explanation system for identified gaps
- Remediation guidance based on gap type
**Importance Score**: 85
**File Path**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

The specification does not contain explicit details about well data models. However, based on the technical summary and overall project context, the following high-level structure can be inferred:

Core Well Data Components:

1. LAS Header Information
- Storage of well log file headers
- Capture of key well metadata
- Management of curve information blocks
- Parameter section handling

2. DepthValidationResult Structure 
- Validation of depth-based measurements
- Quality control flags for depth data
- Correlation between different depth references
- Handling of depth shifts and corrections

3. Well Datasets Schema
- Mapping between raw logs and processed data
- Organization of multi-well information
- Linking of related geological and petrophysical data
- Cross-referencing capabilities

Importance Score: 75/100
The well data models provide critical structure for organizing and validating petrophysical measurements while maintaining industry-standard formatting and relationships.
