## Data Structures

### LAS File Header Model
- Captures essential well metadata and curve definitions
- Stores formation-specific parameters and regional settings
- Manages version information and processing history
- Tracks curve unit standardization states

### DepthValidationResult
A dataclass containing:
- Validated depth ranges with geological context
- Formation boundary markers
- Quality flags for depth measurements
- Zone-specific validation rules

### Well Dataset Mappings
Maps industry-standard curve names and their properties:
- Measurement types and units
- Valid value ranges by formation
- Required companion curves
- Regional calibration parameters

## Core Business Rules

1. Formation-Specific Data Validation
- Depth-dependent density constraints
- Porosity quality thresholds
- Regional parameter variations
- Gap filling methodologies

2. Quality Control Framework
- Industry-standard curve range validation
- Unit compatibility checks
- Cross-curve relationship verification
- Zone-aware data validation

Importance Score: 90/100 (Critical data models for well log analysis)
