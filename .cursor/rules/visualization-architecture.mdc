# visualization-architecture
Based on the technical specification, the visualization architecture primarily focuses on well information display and state management.
### Well Information Display Architecture
- Implements a visualization card system for displaying well metadata
- Uses color-coded status indicators for active well confirmation
- Displays key well attributes (name, UWI, field, depth range) in window titles and report headers
- **Importance Score**: 80
### Multi-Well Visualization Management 
- Maintains separate visualization contexts for multiple loaded wells
- Enables individual or collective well data visualization 
- Includes state isolation to prevent cross-contamination between well displays
- **Importance Score**: 75
### Validation Feedback Visualization
- Renders detailed depth validation feedback with specific failure metrics
- Displays unit conversion previews through dedicated dialog interfaces
- Provides visual indicators for gap classification results
- **Importance Score**: 70
The visualization architecture integrates closely with the well identification system to maintain consistent visual representation of well data across the application interface.

### Figure Registry and Memory Management
**File**: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
**Importance Score**: 80

The visualization architecture implements a specialized memory management system for handling figure objects:

1. Figure Registry
- Maintains centralized tracking of all visualization objects
- Replaces direct matplotlib show() calls with managed Toplevel windows
- Provides controlled cleanup of visualization resources

2. Window Management
- Implements Toplevel window containers for plot isolation
- Prevents memory leaks from orphaned figure objects
- Enables proper disposal of visualization resources between well analyses

3. Well Information Display
- Integrates color-coded well identification cards in Data Tab
- Provides persistent visual confirmation of active well context
- Ensures visualization context safety across multiple wells

4. Display State Management
- Implements comprehensive state cleanup for visualization objects
- Prevents cross-contamination of display elements between wells
- Handles unit conversion preview displays with user confirmation dialogs

The visualization system specifically focuses on maintaining visualization context safety when working with multiple wells, ensuring proper resource cleanup, and providing clear visual indicators for well identification during analysis sessions.
