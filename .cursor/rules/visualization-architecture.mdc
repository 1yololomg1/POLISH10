# visualization-architecture

Based on the technical specification, the visualization architecture primarily focuses on well information display and state management.

### Well Information Display Architecture
- Implements a visualization card system for displaying well metadata
- Uses color-coded status indicators for active well confirmation
- Displays key well attributes (name, UWI, field, depth range) in window titles and report headers
- **Importance Score**: 80

### Multi-Well Visualization Management 
- Maintains separate visualization contexts for multiple loaded wells
- Enables individual or collective well data visualization 
- Includes state isolation to prevent cross-contamination between well displays
- **Importance Score**: 75

### Validation Feedback Visualization
- Renders detailed depth validation feedback with specific failure metrics
- Displays unit conversion previews through dedicated dialog interfaces
- Provides visual indicators for gap classification results
- **Importance Score**: 70

The visualization architecture integrates closely with the well identification system to maintain consistent visual representation of well data across the application interface.
