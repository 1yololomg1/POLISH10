# visualization-architecture
Based on the technical specification, the visualization architecture primarily focuses on well information display and state management.
### Well Information Display Architecture
- Implements a visualization card system for displaying well metadata
- Uses color-coded status indicators for active well confirmation
- Displays key well attributes (name, UWI, field, depth range) in window titles and report headers
- **Importance Score**: 80
### Multi-Well Visualization Management 
- Maintains separate visualization contexts for multiple loaded wells
- Enables individual or collective well data visualization 
- Includes state isolation to prevent cross-contamination between well displays
- **Importance Score**: 75
### Validation Feedback Visualization
- Renders detailed depth validation feedback with specific failure metrics
- Displays unit conversion previews through dedicated dialog interfaces
- Provides visual indicators for gap classification results
- **Importance Score**: 70
The visualization architecture integrates closely with the well identification system to maintain consistent visual representation of well data across the application interface.

Based on the provided specification, there is limited but focused information about the visualization architecture through the referenced UI components:

## Core Components

`ui/visualization.py`
- Generic visualization utilities for displaying petrophysical data
- Basic visualization infrastructure without significant business logic

`ui/status.py`
- Status update display system for visualization operations

## Styling

`.superdesign/design_iterations/default_ui_darkmode.css`
- UI styling definitions for visualization components

## Package Structure

`ui/__init__.py`
- Package initialization for visualization components 

Importance Score: 45/100
The visualization architecture appears to contain primarily standard display utilities without significant specialized business logic or domain-specific implementations.
