# visualization-architecture
Based on the technical specification, the visualization architecture primarily focuses on well information display and state management.
### Well Information Display Architecture
- Implements a visualization card system for displaying well metadata
- Uses color-coded status indicators for active well confirmation
- Displays key well attributes (name, UWI, field, depth range) in window titles and report headers
- **Importance Score**: 80
### Multi-Well Visualization Management 
- Maintains separate visualization contexts for multiple loaded wells
- Enables individual or collective well data visualization 
- Includes state isolation to prevent cross-contamination between well displays
- **Importance Score**: 75
### Validation Feedback Visualization
- Renders detailed depth validation feedback with specific failure metrics
- Displays unit conversion previews through dedicated dialog interfaces
- Provides visual indicators for gap classification results
- **Importance Score**: 70
The visualization architecture integrates closely with the well identification system to maintain consistent visual representation of well data across the application interface.

The visualization system architecture consists of a specialized log display renderer implementing industry-standard petrophysical visualization patterns.

Core Components:

1. Log Display Renderer (`ui/log_display_renderer.py`)
Importance Score: 80/100
- Four-track standard layout following SPWLA display specifications 
- Track configuration system for lithology, resistivity, porosity, and auxiliary data
- Crossover shading patterns for hydrocarbon detection zones
- Formation tops and marker bed visualization overlays

Key Visualization Features:
- Industry-compliant track layouts matching service company standards
- Domain-specific curve scaling and normalization
- Lithology pattern fills based on formation classifications
- Depth-based marker synchronization
- Multi-well correlation display support

Business Rules:
- Track layouts must conform to SPWLA standards
- Crossover patterns follow industry color conventions
- Formation markers require geological validation
- Scale ranges adapt to regional norms
- Depth alignment maintains geological integrity

The visualization system focuses heavily on petrophysical industry standards and conventional log display formats while supporting advanced features like crossover analysis and formation correlation.
