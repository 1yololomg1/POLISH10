# visualization-architecture
Based on the technical specification, the visualization architecture primarily focuses on well information display and state management.
### Well Information Display Architecture
- Implements a visualization card system for displaying well metadata
- Uses color-coded status indicators for active well confirmation
- Displays key well attributes (name, UWI, field, depth range) in window titles and report headers
- **Importance Score**: 80
### Multi-Well Visualization Management 
- Maintains separate visualization contexts for multiple loaded wells
- Enables individual or collective well data visualization 
- Includes state isolation to prevent cross-contamination between well displays
- **Importance Score**: 75
### Validation Feedback Visualization
- Renders detailed depth validation feedback with specific failure metrics
- Displays unit conversion previews through dedicated dialog interfaces
- Provides visual indicators for gap classification results
- **Importance Score**: 70
The visualization architecture integrates closely with the well identification system to maintain consistent visual representation of well data across the application interface.

# visualization-architecture

The visualization architecture implements industry-standard wireline log display conventions with specialized components:

## Core Display Architecture
`ui/log_display_renderer.py` handles the primary 4-track log visualization system:

1. Track Layout Management
- Four-track industry standard configuration
- Service company compatible scaling and spacing
- Automatic depth-based track configuration

2. Industry Color Schemes
- Service company standardized color palettes
- Crossover shading for gas detection zones
- Lithology-specific fill patterns

3. Curve Rendering
- Automated curve placement logic
- Depth correlation alignment
- Track-specific scaling optimization

## Specialized Visual Elements

1. Log Track Configuration
- Standard oil industry 4-track layout
- Service company specification compliance
- Formation correlation indicators

2. Visualization Patterns
- Gas detection crossover highlighting
- Depth-based correlation markers
- Quality control visual indicators

The visualization system focuses on professional wireline log display standards with particular emphasis on service company compatibility and industry-standard track layouts.

Importance Score: 75/100
- Core business visualization requirements
- Industry-standard display conventions
- Professional log visualization compliance
