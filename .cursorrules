## Development Guidelines
- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
The wireline data preprocessing system implements specialized business logic for handling well data validation and management:
### Core Well Management Components

  - Implements safeguards against well data confusion
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
- **Data Validation Framework** (Importance: 85)
  - Specialized depth curve validation with detailed failure analysis
  - Geological feature detection and gap classification 
  - Configurable threshold-based validation rules
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
### Safety and Data Integrity
