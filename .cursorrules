## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Well Processing System

The system implements specialized oil and gas well data preprocessing with emphasis on data integrity and multi-well operations.

### Primary Business Components

1. Well Identification System (80)
- Handles extraction and display of critical well information from LAS headers
- Located in `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

2. Depth Validation Engine (90)
- Provides comprehensive depth curve validation with detailed failure analysis
- Generates actionable remediation steps for validation failures
- Located in `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

3. Multi-Well Processing Framework (85)
- Enables concurrent analysis of multiple wells
- Manages sequential processing and bulk LAS file exports
- Implements state isolation between well operations
- Located in `src/advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### Safety and Validation Systems

1. Unit Conversion Safety System (80)
- Requires explicit user approval for unit conversions
- Displays preview dialogs with conversion risks
- Prevents accidental data corruption

2. Well State Management (85)
- Comprehensive state cleanup between well loads
- Prevents cross-contamination of well data
- Color-coded status indicators for well information

### Error Handling Framework

1. Error Classification System (80)
- User-friendly error messages with specific remediation steps
- Structured error reporting using dataclasses
- Maintains operation history for debugging

2. Error Suppression Management (90)
- Replaces silent error handling with explicit warnings
- Focuses on high-impact operational areas
- Includes quality indicators for degraded operations

### Domain-Specific Features

- Well confusion prevention mechanisms
- Data integrity preservation for critical well information
- Required user confirmations for destructive operations
- Comprehensive well status tracking and display
