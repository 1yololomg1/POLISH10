## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The wireline data preprocessing system implements specialized business logic for handling well data validation and management:

### Core Well Management Components

- **Well Identification Processing** (Importance: 90)
  - Extracts and validates critical well metadata from LAS headers
  - Processes well name, UWI, field, company, date, depth range, location
  - Implements safeguards against well data confusion
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

- **Data Validation Framework** (Importance: 85)
  - Specialized depth curve validation with detailed failure analysis
  - Geological feature detection and gap classification 
  - Configurable threshold-based validation rules
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### Safety and Data Integrity

- **State Management** (Importance: 80)
  - Comprehensive well state isolation
  - Cross-contamination prevention between wells
  - Reset mechanisms for data structures
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

- **Unit Conversion Controls** (Importance: 75)
  - User-approved conversion workflows
  - Conversion preview capabilities
  - Detailed conversion documentation
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### Multi-Well Processing

- **Multi-Well Operations** (Importance: 80)
  - Individual and batch well processing
  - Well-specific processing controls
  - Session-based well management
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### Error Handling

- **Enhanced Error Processing** (Importance: 95)
  - Explicit warning system
  - Detailed error logging
  - Removal of silent error suppression
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`

### Data Analysis

- **Gap Analysis System** (Importance: 85)
  - Distinction between data errors and geological features
  - Threshold-based classification
  - Remediation guidance
  - Location: `advanced_preprocessing_system10.py`
