   - Verify: Open terminal, type "python --version"

2. Open terminal in this folder

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application:
   python advanced_preprocessing_system10.py
   
   OR on Windows: Double-click run.bat

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB+ recommended)
- 500MB disk space
