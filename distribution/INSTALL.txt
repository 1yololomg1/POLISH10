You must install Python separately before running this application.

QUICK INSTALL (4 steps)
------------------------
1. INSTALL PYTHON FIRST (if not already installed)
   - Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Version required: Python 3.8 or higher
   - During installation, CHECK "Add Python to PATH"
   - Verify installation: Open terminal and type "python --version"

2. Install dependencies:
   Open terminal in this folder and run: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
   python advanced_preprocessing_system10.py
   
   OR on Windows, double-click: run.bat

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

STEP 1: Install Python (If Not Already Installed)
---------------------------------------------------
Python is NOT included with this distribution package.
You must download and install it separately.

WHERE TO GET PYTHON:
- Official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Select the latest Python 3.x version (3.8 or higher required)
- Download the installer for your operating system

INSTALLATION TIPS:
- During installation, CHECK THE BOX "Add Python to PATH"
- This is crucial for the application to work!
- Choose "Install for all users" if you have admin rights
- Click "Install Now" (recommended settings)

VERIFY INSTALLATION:
After installing, open a terminal/command prompt and type:
    python --version
    
You should see something like: Python 3.11.x or higher

IF PYTHON IS NOT RECOGNIZED:
- The "Add Python to PATH" option was likely not checked
- You can either:
  1. Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
  2. Manually add Python to your system PATH
  3. Use the full path to python.exe (e.g., C:\Python311\python.exe)

STEP 2: Install Dependencies
-----------------------------
Open terminal/command prompt in this distribution folder and run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install:
- numpy (numerical operations)
- pandas (data handling)
- matplotlib (visualization)
- lasio (LAS file support)
- Optional: scipy, scikit-learn, pywavelets (advanced features)

STEP 3: Run the Application
-----------------------------
From the same terminal/command prompt:

    python advanced_preprocessing_system10.py

The application window should appear.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "python is not recognized"
Solution: Python may not be in your PATH. Use "python3" instead of "python",
          or reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Problem: "No module named 'tkinter'"
Solution (Windows): Usually included with Python. Try: python -m tkinter
Solution (Linux): Install python3-tk: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
Solution (macOS): Usually included with Python installation

Problem: "pip is not recognized"
Solution: Use "python -m pip" instead of "pip"

Problem: Import errors for optional packages
Solution: The application will work without optional packages but with reduced
          functionality. Install them individually:
          pip install scipy scikit-learn pywavelets

PRO TIP: Use Virtual Environment
----------------------------------
To keep dependencies isolated:

1. Create virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv

2. Activate it:
   Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run application:
   python advanced_preprocessing_system10.py
